                                Systems / Plural people are people who share a same body for multiple individuals, or whose identity acts
                                as multiple beings. This can be caused by many different things; in the case of DID (Dissociative Identity
                                Disorder), the identity of the child was unable to merge as one because of childhood trauma, unlike how it
                                usually happen for people.

                                This isn't a fatality; please do not take pity over them. Do not treat them as freaks either; they may be
                                different from you by their experience, but they still have feelings that you should take in consideration.
                                It may seem

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                PluralKit is a discord bot that allows for systems and plural people to use a single discord account while
                                still easily allowing their alters to talk without bothering to explain who is fronting every time. It uses
                                a very smart proxy system that allows the user to switch easily between alters. The way it works can be seen
                                in more details on the official bot website.
                            </p>
                        <h2 class="section1">Why are alters listed as bots ?</h2>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Because of how Discord works, it is impossible to make alters appear as real accounts; PluralKit uses webhooks
                                to make it possible for alters to show individual messages and allow all the features that PluralKit has.
                                Although the different alters appear as bots, they are not bots; please do not refer to them as such unless
                                specified differently by the alter themself.
                            </p>

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                They may share their body with many other people, they are still capable of feelings and should be treated
                                by other members as their own individuals. In some cases, alters may merge; an alter can absorb another, or
                                two alters can fuse to become another. You are not entitled to force them into creating that alter back; you
                                might have gotten emotionally attached to them, but just like with any other friend, you have to learn to let
                                go when they aren't here anymore.
                            </p>
                        <h2 class="section1">I think I might be plural/ a system. What should I do ?</h2>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Firstly, do not panic; this might be stressful and overwhelming to realize this, but as said earlier, it is not
                                a fatality. Plural people and systems are nothing rare; there is roughly as much people with DID than there is
                                red headed people in the world. One thing you will face in your journey is difficulty to have a diagnostic; your
                                relatives and friends might downplay it and brush it off, but if you have doubts, and you are able to have an
                                official diagnostic from a therapist specialized in this kind of issues, you might still want to try.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                after obtention of a diagnostic, you will still face difficulties. Systems and plural people are widely
                                misunderstood by the general population, and a wide range of them will hate you out of misinformation. Culture
                                has portrayed you as a chaotic, unpredictable potentially dangerous being. Often, people might fear you will try
                                to murder them. These are all preconceived ideas often found in media like movies, books, but also newspapers;
                                despite the wide majority of murderers being neurotypical people, and neuro-atypical people being less likely to
                                commit crimes than their neurotypical counterparts, they are still faced with the stigma that they are dangerous
                                people. This is something that must be taken in consideration when telling people that you are plural; people
                                will usually not understand, and some can react wildly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                of course, this does not mean you are doomed to loneliness; many communities like ours welcome systems and
                                plural people and will do their best to make you feel at ease. There are probably organizations in your
                                country who will provide help, so try to get in touch with them.

                                it isn't an easy life to be plural/a system, but it is not a fatality. You can find help to deal with the
                                difficulties you will face at school, at work, and in all of your life. You can find online ressources to learn
                                how to re-organize with your other alters in mind, and how to deal with littles or persecutors if you have any
                                of this kind of alter.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                even though it is specified on the official pluralKit website that it is okay to use the bot for roleplaying
                                purpose, it is preferred by the plural community to use other bots such as tupperbox in order to do this. this
                                is because, where the bot is only for entertainment purpose for roleplayers, it is a life saving tool for
                                plural users, and so many people using it causes issues with data storage or malfunctions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                one could argue that plural people could be the ones to move from the bot to another; but for a bot named
                                pluralKit, you would expect its user demographic to be, in majority, plural people, and not solely roleplayers.
                                pluralKit was designed for plural people, and roleplayers are only tolerated to use it; but when many different
                                tools are available, like tupperbox, we should be able to let plural people have their tools be functional, and
                                not go offline every once in a while.
