                            <p class="paragraph">Bowsette's Castle is a discord server created for trans people by trans people as 
                                a safe place. The server has been online for over a year, and it's only getting bigger and better!
                                The moderation team works diligently to provide security for all the members, safe guarding the server from
                                potential transphobes, raiders, or chasers that might try to join. But this server isn't restricted to trans people.
                                If you are a cis person, a non-binary person who doesn't identify as trans, or a system/plural person, you
                                are also welcome! We have a diverse community with the only requirements being acceptance and respect for the other members.

                            </p>
